# Compatibility Testing Report – Task-02

**Test Subject**: Demo E‑commerce Web Page (HTML provided for internship task)  
**Internship**: Software Testing Internship – Prodigy InfoTech  
**Tester**: Adithi  
**Date**: November 2025

This report documents compatibility testing results for a demo e‑commerce site across multiple browsers and devices. The goal is to identify layout issues, broken links, and functionality discrepancies.

###  Browser: Chrome (Desktop)
- Page tested: Demo E‑com HTML site
- Layout:  Grid and navbar render correctly
- Links:  “Sale” link leads to 404 (intentional for testing)
- Functionality:  Modal and form alerts working

###  Suggested Fixes
- On Firefox mobile view, the “Add to Cart” button overlaps the footer on the demo e‑commerce site.
- Add media queries to improve layout responsiveness.

> *Note: The demo site was built specifically for compatibility testing and includes intentional issues (e.g., broken link) to validate QA documentation.*
