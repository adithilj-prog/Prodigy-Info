## Software Testing Task

This repository contains my ongoing work for the **Software Testing  Tasks**.  
It documents each assigned task with reports, demo code, and testing artifacts.

##  Current Contents
- **Task-01.md** → Test cases for a calculator application.
- **Task-02.md** → Compatibility testing report for a demo e-commerce site.
- **Task-03.md** → Automation testing report and Selenium scripts.
- **Task-04.md** → Cross-browser testing documentation and scripts (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

##  Upcoming Tasks
Additional tasks will be added here as I complete them during the internship.  
This repo will continue to grow with new reports and deliverables.

##  Purpose
- Showcase practical QA and testing skills.
- Demonstrate structured documentation in Markdown.
- Provide transparency with demo code, automation scripts, and reports.
